Cross-platform runtime for web apps.

## About

WebFrame is a portable application runtime for web based apps to run 
in either a browser or a desktop environment. By creating an abstract 
bridge between HTML/Javascript and C++, WebFrame handles all platform 
and target specific logic, leaving developers to focus on presentation 
in the frontend, and processing in the backend.

The immediate goal is to provide a working solution for anyone who is 
looking to develop simple web apps for both desktop and browser. The 
existing projects either lack target portability(WebView), or require 
a significant portion of the HTML/Javascript logic to process in the 
backend(Electron).

The ultimate goal is to extend the features and completeness of this 
project, such that it is an appealing alternative to Electron. While 
the performance of Electron is often cited as a weakness, it remains 
popular due to its strengths, namely features and ease of use.
